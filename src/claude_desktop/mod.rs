//! Switching which Claude account the **Claude Desktop app** is signed in as,
//! carrying local history along so the account you land on shows the union of
//! everything rather than only its own conversations.
//!
//! The Claude Desktop internals this relies on — the data-directory layout, the
//! `oauth:tokenCache` / `oauth:tokenCacheV2` / `lastKnownAccountUuid` fields in
//! `config.json`, which cookie and LevelDB stores carry the renderer's "who am
//! I", the newest-wins rule for session indexes, and the reason
//! `bridge-state.json` must be deleted rather than restored — were
//! reverse-engineered by **claude-acc** (<https://github.com/ohmaseclaro/claude-acc>,
//! MIT). [`plan_switch`]/[`apply_switch`] are a port of its `cmd_switch`, and
//! they read and write its profile store so the two tools stay interchangeable.
//! claude-acc still owns capturing (`add`), forgetting (`remove`), and chat
//! filtering (`only`/`reset`); this module deliberately covers read + switch.
//!
//! Nothing here is compiled out on Linux. Every path is injected through
//! [`Paths`], the platform commands live behind [`app::AppControl`], and the
//! whole thing simply finds no data directory on a machine with no Claude
//! Desktop app — which keeps the logic under CI's clippy and its tests running
//! everywhere.
