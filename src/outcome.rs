//! What a vendor fetch produced: a snapshot, plus how much to trust it.
//!
//! Every vendor answers the same four questions — what the numbers are,
//! whether they came from a live call or a stale cache, what the last failure
//! was, and how old the payload is — so every vendor declared the same struct
//! and the same three helpers around it. Eighteen copies of a four-field
//! record is only tedious; eighteen copies of the *policy* is a hazard, and it
//! had already gone wrong twice in this family:
//!
//! - the cold-cache error, which five vendors replaced with a generic "no
//!   usable cache" while thirteen returned the real one;
//! - an unparseable cached payload, which some vendors reported as a cache
//!   parse error and others as the original fetch failure.
//!
//! Both are settled here once. A vendor supplies its snapshot type and a
//! closure that parses its own cache format; everything else is shared.
